# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module10

## Part I
* An analysis was performed on Jupyter Notebook in order to create a precipitation analysis of Hawaii, by using Pandas, Matplotlib, and SQLAlchemy ORM queries.
* A station analysis was designed in order to find the most active station, and then querying the last 12 months from that set of temperature observation, the results were plotted by using a histogram.

## Part II
* A Flask API was created on VSCode to create routes, based on the queries developed in part I.
* Unfortunately, I was only able to create a stations route, as I kept encountering an error code that my path wasn't correct for the others, and that my "hawaii.sqlite" file was not utf-8 encoded.
